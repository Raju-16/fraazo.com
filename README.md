Clone of Fraazo.com

Hello everyone. I'm a student at Masai School which is a tech educational institute. The first and foremost thing is that we want to thank Masai School for this wonderful opportunity and also want to express gratitude for teaching us this type of skill set so that's why I can do this project in a week. I was asked to do the clone of Fraazo.com which is an e-commerce website where you can buy various types of vegetables, fruits, herbs, and dry fruits.

How We Started The Project
I was pretty excited about the project as it was my first solo project. I started my planning around 9:30 A.M on every day and I decided on all the factors and then targeting on the one finality and completed it at the end of the day and also needed to be taken care of while creating the project like how much time I should give this to a particular section because you have to do all the thing and started working at 10:00 am with full of energy and dedication and happiness.

Difficulties I faced
when you create a clone of the whole website then you have to care for each and everything you have to manage the most important thing is TIME. it is very much important with the volume of work that you have to do I before the deadline time and also with the maximum function on working condition. so you have to take care of your work with respect to time.

Learnings
After completing the project I realized one thing teamwork is always easier than solo work because the work quantity is less on each and everyone so they can make more attractive web pages and sometimes we stuck in very general of the small problem and due to some reason you not able to catch it fast that time you feel if you work in a team then they can help you.
